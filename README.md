# My Website

**Catalina Ca√±izares**

This repository hosts the code for my website, which I regularly update. 

I take great pleasure in creating and maintaining it! As a fan of open-source science, I firmly believe in sharing knowledge and inspiring others. 

While I am just beginning my career, I aim to continue building on the knowledge I have acquired. As a proponent of a teaching philosophy that emphasizes sharing and collaboration, I will always be open to sharing my work and experiences. So, have fun exploring how I built my website!
