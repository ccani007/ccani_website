## Understanding Negative Affect in Adults

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
Currently I am working in a publication that aims to examine the extent to which cognitive schemas, attributional style, experiences of child adversity, and lifestyle factors such as alcohol, drug use, and physical activity are risk factors can accurately predict Negative Affect in a sample of both depressed and non-depressed adults in Colombia `r emo::ji("colombia")` using regression trees.

This project seeks to address the inconsistent research findings surrounding the correlation between mass casualties and suicide morbidity. Our goal is to contribute to the existing literature on the mental health effects of natural disasters, specifically by investigating whether mass casualty events increase a young person's susceptibility to suicidal ideation and planning. To achieve this objective, we will examine the relationship between mass casualty events reported across the United States `r emo::ji("america")` from 1990 to 2019 and data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) collected during the same time frame, with a focus on school districts.

## [`tidyDisasters`](https://ccani007.github.io/tidyDisasters/)

This project is a sub-project of *The effect of natural disasters and suicidality*, and aims to merge three different datasets - Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), Global Terrorism Database (GTD), and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) - into a set of relational databases in the fifth normal form. The merging process is based on data equivalence criteria, and the creation of this R Package takes into account the lack of consistency between the three datasets in determining the reported event type.

This project is a sub-project of "The effect of natural disasters and suicidality" and its goal is to create a comprehensive R package containing the YRBS data for streamlined analysis. While the CDC website allows downloading of the data, the process can be lengthy, particularly when using the SPSS route. With this package, all the data will be conveniently located in one place and organized in a fifth normal form. Additionally, useful functions will be developed to allow for efficient interaction with the data. As the project is still under construction, it is currently only available through my  [![](img/github.svg)](https://github.com/ccani007/tidyYRBS) repository.
