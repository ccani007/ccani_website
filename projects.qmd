## Understanding Negative Affect in Adults

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
Currently I am working in a publication that aims to examine the extent to which cognitive schemas, attributional style, experiences of child adversity, and lifestyle factors such as alcohol, drug use, and physical activity are risk factors can accurately predict Negative Affect in a sample of both depressed and non-depressed adults in Colombia `r emo::ji("colombia")` using regression trees.

## The Impact of Mass Casualty Events on Adolescent Suicidality

This project seeks to address the inconsistent research findings surrounding the correlation between mass casualties and suicide morbidity. Our goal is to contribute to the existing literature on the mental health effects of natural disasters, specifically by investigating whether mass casualty events increase a young person's susceptibility to suicidal ideation and planning. To achieve this objective, we will examine the relationship between mass casualty events reported across the United States `r emo::ji("america")` from 1990 to 2019 and data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) collected during the same time frame, with a focus on school districts.

## [`tidyDisasters`](https://ccani007.github.io/tidyDisasters/)

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
This project is a sub-project of *The Impact of Mass Casualty Events on Adolescent Suicidality*, and aims to merge three different datasets - Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), Global Terrorism Database (GTD), and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) - into a set of relational databases in the fifth normal form. The merging process is based on data equivalence criteria, and the creation of this R Package takes into account the lack of consistency between the three datasets in determining the reported event type.

This project is a sub-project of *The Impact of Mass Casualty Events on Adolescent Suicidality* and its goal is to create a comprehensive R package containing the YRBS data for streamlined analysis. While the CDC website allows downloading of the data, the process can be lengthy, particularly when using the SPSS route. With this package, all the data will be conveniently located in one place and organized in a fifth normal form. Additionally, useful functions will be developed to allow for efficient interaction with the data. As the project is still under construction, it is currently only available through my  [![](img/github.svg)](https://github.com/ccani007/tidyYRBS) repository.

## Dissertation - Comparing Supervised Machine Learning Classification Methods to Identify Risk Factors for Suicide Morbidity Among USA High School Students

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
As of December 2022, my research proposal on adolescent suicide morbidity has been approved, and I am currently focused on building the code to analyze the data.

## Persistent Sadness and Hopelessness in Youth: A Supervised Machine Learning Classification Approach to Identify Risk Factors
::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {.column width="55%"}
Feelings of hopelessness in adolescents have been consistently linked to mental health outcomes such as depression and suicidality, including suicide ideation and attempts. In recognition of its importance, hopelessness has been added to the DSM and is considered within risk-factor guidelines and integrated into structured suicide-risk assessments. Despite this, research exploring risk factors that increase the likelihood of adolescents feeling hopeless is scarce and hopelessness has acquired secondary consideration in literature. Therefore I am working in a publication that aims to address this gap by investigating the effect of intra and interpersonal risk and protective factors on adolescent hopelessness.

## Understanding Adolescent Alcohol Consumption: A Decision Tree Analysis Using the YRBSS 2019 Data

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
As part of my ongoing passion to help prevent adolescents from engaging in self-harm and promote their success as adults, I am currently involved in a project aimed at understanding the risk factors associated with drinking behaviors. Although this project is in its early stages, our team has already developed a decision tree to identify the primary risk factors that contribute to alcohol consumption among US adolescents. These risk factors include using vaping products, engaging in risky sexual behaviors, using drugs, and others.

## Exploring Gratitude in Children: Evaluating an Instrument to Measure Factors and Impact on Well-Being

::: {.column width="55%"}
As my research primarily focuses on negative emotions such as depression, hopelessness, negative affect, and suicide, I strive to maintain a balanced approach by exploring positive emotions as well. Currently, I am conducting a project that delves into gratitude in children, which has been found to be a significant factor in fostering resilience and building positive social relationships.

Our project aims to evaluate an instrument that measures gratitude in children. To gather empirical evidence about its underlying factors, we are performing both confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses on a sample of 503 children from Colombia `r emo::ji("colombia")`. By doing so, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to gratitude in children and its potential impact on their overall well-being.
