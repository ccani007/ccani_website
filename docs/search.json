    "text": "Persistent Sadness and Hopelessness in Youth: A Supervised Machine Learning Classification Approach to Identify Risk Factors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeelings of hopelessness in adolescents have been consistently linked to mental health outcomes such as depression and suicidality, including suicide ideation and attempts. In recognition of its importance, hopelessness has been added to the DSM and is considered within risk-factor guidelines and integrated into structured suicide-risk assessments. Despite this, research exploring risk factors that increase the likelihood of adolescents feeling hopeless is scarce and hopelessness has acquired secondary consideration in literature. Therefore I am working in a publication that aims to address this gap by investigating the effect of intra and interpersonal risk and protective factors on adolescent hopelessness.

Although this project is in its early stages, our team has already developed a decision tree to identify the primary risk factors that contribute to alcohol consumption among US adolescents. These risk factors include using vaping products, engaging in risky sexual behaviors, using drugs, and others."

Currently, I am conducting a project that delves into gratitude in children, which has been found to be a significant factor in fostering resilience and building positive social relationships.\nOur project aims to evaluate an instrument that measures gratitude in children. To gather empirical evidence about its underlying factors, we are performing both confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses on a sample of 503 children from Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´. By doing so, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to gratitude in children and its potential impact on their overall well-being."

Our team is currently in the first phase of the project, where we are working to collect as much data as possible.\nIn my role, I have focused on coordination and strategic planning, and have contributed several ideas to the project. One of these ideas was to develop a website that could provide comprehensive information to potential participants and present a welcoming and aesthetically pleasing interface. To achieve this goal, I collaborated with two colleagues from FIU to design and develop a beautiful website. I invite you to visit the website and explore its content."
