In recognition of its importance, hopelessness has been added to the DSM and is considered within risk-factor guidelines and integrated into structured suicide-risk assessments. Despite this, research exploring risk factors that increase the likelihood of adolescents feeling hopeless is scarce and hopelessness has acquired secondary consideration in literature. Therefore I am working in a publication that aims to address this gap by investigating the effect of intra and interpersonal risk and protective factors on adolescent hopelessness.

Our aim is to identify the psychosocial interventions delivered to victims and first responders following mass casualty events, whether man-made or natural. To date, we have meticulously screened 13,370 articles, conducted full-text reviews of 161, and extracted data from 64. Currently, we are in the process of constructing tables to further the analysis. We anticipate having results in the near future and will soon commence writing the manuscript."

Currently, I am conducting a project that delves into gratitude in children, which has been found to be a significant factor in fostering resilience and building positive social relationships.\nOur project aims to evaluate an instrument that measures gratitude in children. To gather empirical evidence about its underlying factors, we are performing both confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses on a sample of 503 children from Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´. By doing so, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to gratitude in children and its potential impact on their overall well-being."
