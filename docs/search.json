Our goal is to contribute to the existing literature on the mental health effects of natural disasters, specifically by investigating whether mass casualty events increase a young personâ€™s susceptibility to suicidal ideation and planning. To achieve this objective, we will examine the relationship between mass casualty events reported across the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ from 1990 to 2019 and data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) collected during the same time frame, with a focus on school districts."

The merging process is based on data equivalence criteria, and the creation of this R Package takes into account the lack of consistency between the three datasets in determining the reported event type."

While the CDC website allows downloading of the data, the process can be lengthy, particularly when using the SPSS route. With this package, all the data will be conveniently located in one place and organized in a fifth normal form. Additionally, useful functions will be developed to allow for efficient interaction with the data. As the project is still under construction, it is currently only available through my  repository."

    "text": "Uncovering the Leading Predictors of Adolescent Hopelessness Through Supervised Machine Learning Classification Algorithms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeelings of hopelessness in adolescents have been consistently linked to mental health outcomes such as depression and suicidality, including suicide ideation and attempts. In recognition of its importance, hopelessness has been added to the DSM and is considered within risk-factor guidelines and integrated into structured suicide-risk assessments. Despite this, research exploring risk factors that increase the likelihood of adolescents feeling hopeless is scarce and hopelessness has acquired secondary consideration in literature. Therefore I am working in a publication that aims to address this gap by investigating the effect of intra and interpersonal risk and protective factors on adolescent hopelessness."

My focus primarily lies in cleaning, understanding, and merging datasets, and conducting comprehensive data exploration analysis using an array of packages such as dplyr, ggplot2, purr, stringr, table1, gtsummary, skimr, and stats.\nLastly, I strongly believe in the principles of reproducible research, and I advocate for it by using Quarto and RMarkdown."
