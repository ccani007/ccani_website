Our goal is to contribute to the existing literature on the mental health effects of natural disasters, specifically by investigating whether mass casualty events increase a young personâ€™s susceptibility to suicidal ideation and planning. To achieve this objective, we will examine the relationship between mass casualty events reported across the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ from 1990 to 2019 and data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) collected during the same time frame, with a focus on school districts."

    "text": "Persistent Sadness and Hopelessness in Youth: A Supervised Machine Learning Classification Approach to Identify Risk Factors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeelings of hopelessness in adolescents have been consistently linked to mental health outcomes such as depression and suicidality, including suicide ideation and attempts. In recognition of its importance, hopelessness has been added to the DSM and is considered within risk-factor guidelines and integrated into structured suicide-risk assessments. Despite this, research exploring risk factors that increase the likelihood of adolescents feeling hopeless is scarce and hopelessness has acquired secondary consideration in literature. Therefore I am working in a publication that aims to address this gap by investigating the effect of intra and interpersonal risk and protective factors on adolescent hopelessness."

Although this project is in its early stages, our team has already developed a decision tree to identify the primary risk factors that contribute to alcohol consumption among US adolescents. These risk factors include using vaping products, engaging in risky sexual behaviors, using drugs, and others."

Currently, I am conducting a project that delves into gratitude in children, which has been found to be a significant factor in fostering resilience and building positive social relationships.\nOur project aims to evaluate an instrument that measures gratitude in children. To gather empirical evidence about its underlying factors, we are performing both confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses on a sample of 503 children from Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´. By doing so, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to gratitude in children and its potential impact on their overall well-being."

Utilizing machine learning classification techniques, I aim to identify critical risk factors for adolescent suicide morbidity and make a significant impact in this area of study.\nMy passion lies in data science and its application to mental health-related issues. Recently, I have broadened my skill set by working extensively in both R and Python environments. My focus primarily lies in cleaning, understanding, and merging datasets, and conducting comprehensive data exploration analysis using an array of packages such as dplyr, ggplot2, purr, stringr, table1, gtsummary, skimr, and stats.\nLastly, I strongly believe in the principles of reproducible research, and I advocate for it by using Quarto and RMarkdown."
