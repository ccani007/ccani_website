Our goal is to contribute to the existing literature on the mental health effects of natural disasters, specifically by investigating whether mass casualty events increase a young personâ€™s susceptibility to suicidal ideation and planning. To achieve this objective, we will examine the relationship between mass casualty events reported across the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ from 1990 to 2019 and data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) collected during the same time frame, with a focus on school districts."

The merging process is based on data equivalence criteria, and the creation of this R Package takes into account the lack of consistency between the three datasets in determining the reported event type."

While the CDC website allows downloading of the data, the process can be lengthy, particularly when using the SPSS route. With this package, all the data will be conveniently located in one place and organized in a fifth normal form. Additionally, useful functions will be developed to allow for efficient interaction with the data. As the project is still under construction, it is currently only available through my  repository."

My research aims are:\n\nIdentify critical risk factors for adolescent suicide morbidity from a set of 99 risk behavior predictors, using machine learning classification algorithms.\nIdentify the best machine learning methodology for classifying adolescents who have attempted and considered suicide, based on performance measures such as the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, overall accuracy, and the Kappa value.\nCompare the performance of an a priori-determined model with models informed by feature selection from LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method).\nInvestigate whether there are differences in the critical risk factors for suicide ideation and suicide attempts.\n\nI am using tidymodels to build the code for this analysis, and I am excited to share my findings once the study is complete.\nYou can view the slides to my research proposal by clicking here! ðŸ‘€"

My focus primarily lies in cleaning, understanding, and merging datasets, and conducting comprehensive data exploration analysis using an array of packages such as dplyr, ggplot2, purr, stringr, table1, gtsummary, skimr, and stats.\nLastly, I strongly believe in the principles of reproducible research, and I advocate for it by using Quarto and RMarkdown."
