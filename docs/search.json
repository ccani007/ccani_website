    "text": "Hi there!\nI am a researcher dedicated to preventing suicidal behaviors in adolescents. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. My work spans several projects, including intervention programs for preventing suicide attempts and developing data structures to deepen our understanding of adolescent suicide attempts and ideation.\nI am deeply invested in data science, applying machine learning techniques to reveal insights and patterns in suicide-related data. As a primary user of R, I am committed to sharing my knowledge and experiences with the broader community.\nI am also dedicated to ensuring clarity and reproducibility in my work, using tools like Quarto and RMarkdown. This approach ensures that my research is trustworthy and easily followed by others."

The results demonstrate that integrating LASSO with logistic regression and addressing data imbalance significantly enhances predictive sensitivity, achieving an 80% accuracy rate.

This study examines how cognitive schemas, attributional style, childhood adversity, and lifestyle factors (alcohol, drug use, and physical activity) predict Negative Affect in both depressed and non-depressed adults in Colombia üá®üá¥ using regression trees. The findings revealed that cognitive schemas of disconnection/rejection and impaired autonomy significantly impact negative affect, with childhood adversity as a crucial determining factor.

    "text": "Persistent Sadness and Hopelessness in Youth: A Supervised Machine Learning Classification Approach to Identify Risk Factors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeelings of hopelessness in adolescents have been consistently linked to mental health outcomes such as depression and suicidality, including suicide ideation and attempts. In recognition of its importance, hopelessness has been added to the DSM and is considered within risk-factor guidelines and integrated into structured suicide-risk assessments. Despite this, research exploring risk factors that increase the likelihood of adolescents feeling hopeless is scarce and hopelessness has acquired secondary consideration in literature. Therefore I am working in a publication that aims to address this gap by investigating the effect of intra and interpersonal risk and protective factors on adolescent hopelessness.

Our aim is to identify the psychosocial interventions delivered to victims and first responders following mass casualty events, whether man-made or natural. To date, we have meticulously screened 13,370 articles, conducted full-text reviews of 161, and extracted data from 64. Currently, we are in the process of constructing tables to further the analysis. We anticipate having results in the near future and will soon commence writing the manuscript."
