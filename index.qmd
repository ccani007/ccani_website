My passion lies in data science and its application to mental health-related issues. Recently, I have broadened my skill set by working extensively in`R`. My focus primarily lies in cleaning, understanding, and merging datasets, conducting comprehensive data exploration analysis using an array of packages such as `tidyverse`, `table1`, `gtsummary`, `skimr`, and applying statistical methods using `tidymodels`.

Lastly, I strongly believe in the principles of reproducible research, and I advocate for it by using `Quarto` and `RMarkdown`.
