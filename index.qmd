Hi there! 

I'm a passionate data scientist and a Ph.D. candidate in Social Welfare, dedicated to using data to gain insights into emotional disorders. I've been delving deep into data analysis, especially with `R`. My focus? Making data understandable and useful.

I specialize in cleaning and merging data, and I love exploring data with tools like `tidyverse`, `table1`, `gtsummary`, and `skimr` among others. I'm also interested in using Machine Learning models, with the `tidymodels` package, to better understand emotional disorders.

Plus, I'm all about keeping things clear and reproducible by using tools such as `Quarto` and `RMarkdown`. That means you can trust my work, and it can be easily followed by others.
